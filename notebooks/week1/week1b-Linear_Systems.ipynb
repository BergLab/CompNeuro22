This subtle distinction is important because it means that we do not need to define division.  We only need to find the number, that when multiplied by $A$ gives 1.  This number is called the multiplicative inverse of $A$ and is written as $1/A$, so long as $A\\neq 0$.\n",

This zero vector is called a trivial solution because it is a solution to *every homogeneous system* $AX=0$, regardless of the entries of $A$.
