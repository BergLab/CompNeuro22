# CompNeuro22

‚ò¢Ô∏è *Please, read carefully all the information here before the course starts*

The course will consists of three types of classes: **Lectures** where you learn some concepts relevant in computational neuroscience, **Coding exercises** where you get to practice what you learn during lecture and **Invited talks** researches will come talk about their current research.

The **lectures** will follow a hybrid flipped classroom structure: we will give you some material ‚Äîtypically a video playlist‚Äî that you need to watch before coming to class. These materials are meant for you to refresh some notions of build an intuitions about the concepts, during class we will build on them. The links to the supporting material can be found in the course timeline table below.

The **coding exercises** will be done in groups, the idea is that you work autonomously on them and ask us if you have questions. 
You're welcome to meet before the exercise class to work through the exercises with your group colleagues or, if you don't have the time to finish them during the session, to finish them afterwards. During the first lecture we will detail the role of the exercises in the exam.
We will have 4 groups named: Drosophila ü™∞, C Elegans ü™±, Giant Squid ü¶ë and Rattus norvegicus üêÄ. We've tried to have balanced groups regarding coding skills. The groups members can seen in Absalon.



## ü§ì Before the course starts

### Preparation

If you have never coded or used python before (or it's been a while), we strongly recommend that you take this introduction course to python: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python

It's made of 7 lessons covering all you need to know about python to complete our course. Each lesson consist of a **tutorial** and some simple **exercises**. The exercises are hosted online as notebooks so you can do them without installing anything on your computer. 


### Set-up for coding

Similarly to the aforementioned python course, our course exercises will take the form of "notebooks", notebooks a document format that allows you to run code, write text and generate plots in the same document. They are made of *cells*, which can be *code cells* or *text cells*. In most notebooks, you can execute a cell by pressing *Shift + Enter*.

You have two options for doing the exercises: 
  * the simplest one is to use Google Colab which lets you do the exercises online so you don't need to do any set-up on your computer. To open the exercises simply click on badge "Open in Colab" of the notebook you want to open it in Colab.

  * The second option is to install an editor (the app where you type code) and python in your computer. This option has the advantage of letting you work more easily with your own data and having some nice extra features. If you pick this option, we recommend you get editor Spyder. A simple way of installing both Spyder editor and Python is to install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution . Then you can simply download the notebooks folder in this repository and open them in your computer.

If you're already comfortable using other editor, you're more than welcome to keep it using.
